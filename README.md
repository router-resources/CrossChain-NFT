# `CrossChain NFT`

> Effortlessly transfer NFT's from one chain to another. Made using Router Cross-Talk.

🚀DEMO: [Link to be given]

This project is built with [Router CrossTalk](https://dev.routerprotocol.com/crosstalk-library/overview/introduction)

Router Protocol is a solution introduced to address the issues hindering the usability of cross-chain liquidity migration in the DeFi ecosystem. It acts as a bridge connecting various layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, allowing for the flow of contract-level data across them. The Router Protocol can either transfer tokens between chains or initiate operations on one chain and execute them on another.

Please check the [official documentation of Router Protocol](https://www.routerprotocol.com/)
